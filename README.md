Description:
  ## 🚀 Abdul Latif Commission Shop App

This project is a high-fidelity mobile application prototype for the **Abdul Latif Commission Shop**, developed using **Flutter** under the strict constraint of using the **`Container` widget** as the primary building block for all layout and styling. The application features a complete e-commerce flow, including a hero section **Home Screen**, a **Products** page with a stateful shopping cart for **pound-based quantity tracking**, a detailed **Payment** screen with functional `TextField` forms and method selection, and dedicated **Contact Us** and **Delivery Details** pages, demonstrating professional UI design achieved using fundamental Flutter primitives.
